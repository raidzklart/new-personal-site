Another Free Code Camp Project. 
This one is part of the ‘Responsive Web Design Projects’. 
To build it I used HTML with the [Materialize CSS framework](https://materializecss.com/){:.text-danger}. The specs can be found on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page){:.text-danger}.
